# FRPS Log Analysis Tool

This tool is designed to enhance the security of FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) by reviewing FRPS log files to list the IPs and services with the highest number of connections.

## Features
- Passed the FRP 0.52-0.60 test, as long as the FRP does not change the current (version 0.60) log format
- Review FRPS log files.
- Whitelist IPs can be set.
- Concise report format with at-a-glance visibility into which service and which IP has the most connections.
- Support for sending report emails.
- Only IPv4 is supported

## Get started quickly

1. Clone the repository or download the project file.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/zsanjin-p/frps-log-analyze
   ```

2. Modify the '.env' environment variable file to configure the following variables according to your environment:

- 'FRPS_LOG_PATH': FRPS log file path (required).
   - 'MONITORED_NAMES': The name of the service to be monitored (separated by commas). Leave blank to monitor all names.
   - 'WHITELIST_IPS': IP whitelist, comma separated.
   - 'OUTPUT_PATH': The path where the report saves the analysis results.
   - 'RANK_LIMIT': The number of top items displayed in the results.
   - 'SMTP_SERVER': The SMTP server configuration used to send emails.
   - 'SMTP_PORT': The SMTP server configuration used to send emails.
   - 'SMTP_USE_TLS': The SMTP server configuration used to send emails.
   - 'SMTP_USERNAME': The SMTP server configuration used to send emails.
   - 'SMTP_PASSWORD': The SMTP server configuration used to send emails.
   - 'EMAIL_SENDER': The sender of the email.
   - 'EMAIL_RECIPIENTS': The recipient of the email.

## Configuration and Use

Fill it out. For ENV files, except for the FRPS log location, you can leave it unfilled.
Logging needs to be enabled in frps.toml.
With the scheduled task program, it is executed once a day, because the frps.log only keeps the log of the current day and archives it every other day.
